## About

This portfolio website is designed to provide information about me, Jack Carron, and my work as a developer. It includes details about my skills, projects I've worked on, and ways to contact me. Feel free to explore my website and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities.

## Technologies Used

- React: This website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Create React App: The project was bootstrapped with Create React App, which provides a solid foundation for React applications.
- Other dependencies: Various other libraries and packages are used to enhance the functionality and appearance of the website. You can find the complete list in the `package.json` file.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JackCarron/jcarron.net.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd jcarron-portfolio

3. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start

5. This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

6. Make your desired changes to the code. The app will automatically reload if you make any edits.

7. Build the production-ready version when you're ready to deploy:

    ```bash
    npm run build

8. You can then deploy the contents of the build folder to your web hosting service. jcarron.net uses an S3 bucket to store the build folder contents, and serve that s3 bucket via AWS cloudfront distribution.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

    npm start: Runs the app in development mode.
    npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
    npm test: Launches the test runner.
    npm run eject: Ejects Create React App configuration.

For more details on these scripts, refer to the Create React App documentation.
